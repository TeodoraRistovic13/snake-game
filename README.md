# Snake Game

This project is a version of the classic Snake game. The player controls the snake, aiming to collect as many points as possible before colliding with the game board walls or itself.

## Points are earned by eating:

- **Regular food** (red circle) → +1 point  
- **Super food** (yellow square) → +10 points  

The snake is controlled using the **arrow keys** (Up, Down, Left, Right). Each time it eats regular food, its length increases by one unit. The game starts with a length of **1**.  

- **Regular food** remains in the same position until eaten.  
- **Super food** appears **every 10 seconds** at a random position and stays on the board for **3 seconds** before disappearing and reappearing elsewhere.  

At the end of the game, the player can **save their score** by entering a name. A **leaderboard** displays the top **5 best scores**, with the most recent game **highlighted in yellow**.
